## css-100

ðŸŽ¨ My version of the <a href="https://100dayscss.com/about/">100 Days of CSS challenge</a>.

## Objective

For the next 100 days, I'm committing to tackle at least one CSS challenge a day. My goal is to refine my CSS skills, explore diverse styling techniques, and delve into crafting pure CSS artwork and animations.

A version of my completed daily challenge can be found on my own dedicated website at <a href="https://css100.aniqa.dev">css100.aniqa.dev</a>. In addition to that, I'll be submitting CodePens to the official <a href="https://100dayscss.com/progress/aniqatc/">challenge website</a> where my progress will also be tracked.

## Project Structure

This project includes a series of completed challenges, with the first **50** utilizing **HTML**, **CSS**, and occasionally JavaScript for necessary functionalities, and the final **50** utilizes the same except with **SCSS** to practice more complex styling.

#### General Webpage Resources

- The `/src` directory holds all files related to the general structure and styling of the webpage, as well as the main script for loading each entry
- The `/public` directory contains all production-ready code, bundled and optimized using Webpack

#### Challenges Directory

Each challenge is self-contained in its own directory within `/entries`, labeled by day number (e.g., `/001`, `/023`). Within each challenge's directory, you will find:

- `style.css` or `style.scss`: Contains all the CSS or SCSS styling specific to the challenge
- `content.js`: Returns the HTML markup needed for the challenge
- `script.js`: Holds any JavaScript code required for the challenge's functionality
- `README.md`: Provides insights and learning takeaways from each challenge

<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> To prevent class naming conflicts, each challenge will be wrapped with a unique parent class corresponding to the day of the challenge (e.g., `.day-001`, `.day-023`). This convention allows for the use of descendant selectors to target elements within a specific challenge's scope, ensuring that styles do not bleed across challenges.
