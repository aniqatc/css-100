# css-100

ðŸŽ¨ My version of the <a href="https://100dayscss.com/about/">100 Days of CSS challenge</a>.

---

Starting at Day 1, I'll be completing at least one CSS challenge a day for the next 100 days in order to improve how I write CSS and to explore different ways of styling components or creating pure CSS art.

I'll be adding a version of my completed challenge to my own website at <a href="https://css-100.aniqa.dev">css-100.aniqa.dev</a> in addition to submitting <a href="https://codepen.io/aniqatc">Codepen</a> links to the official challenge website.

All challenges will be written in pure **HTML** & **CSS** with occasional JavaScript for functionality (basically, no CSS frameworks.. _for now_).

Each challenge's CSS file will be in a separate folder (inside `/entries`) along with a README file that'll make note of any new concepts or tricks that I learned. However, all markup will be inside the main `index.html` file.
