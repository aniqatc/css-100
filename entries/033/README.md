**Time to Complete**: 20 mins

**Key Concepts**: positioning and animating SVG elements

**Notes**:

Another super simple challenge! Specifically because the SVG elements are already defined using the `<path>` tag and I didn't see any use in re-doing it myself. So, all I did was position each of the clouds at different starting positions using absolute positioning and then, applied the same `@keyframes` animation to each cloud but with a different duration so that the clouds move at different speeds. The animation simply moves the clouds across the X-axis using `transform: translate()`.
