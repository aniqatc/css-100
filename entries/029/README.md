**Time to Complete**: 30 mins

**Key Concepts**: styling input text elements

**Notes**:

This challenge was super straightforward:

- I styled the `<input>` element along with the placeholder using the `::placeholder` pseudo-element
- I used an `<ul>` element (unordered list) to style the suggestions that appear when a character is typed into the `<input>` field
- I used JavaScript to dynamically add the `<li>` elements using the `input` event listener
